Before I start, let me say I **love software**, and even more, I love talking about software, if you'd like to start a conversation please do get in touch ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavdraper/), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gavdraper)). 

I've been messing around with computers since we got our first family a computer (486SX 50Mhz 4Mb with a CD-ROM!), at some point a free version (Possibly a trial) of Borlands Delphi 1.0 with a magazine, from that moment on I was hooked. I went through book after book learning how to use the thing, and pretty much haven't stopped since (I did, however, move on from Delphi 1.0 at some point, weirdly my next step was Pascal).

I've spent most of my working career in the finance sector either Airline Accounting or Investment Management, The main reason I've spent so long here are the interesting problems that come out of it, from the volumes of data to processing, controls and measures. As for where I'll end up next, it may be finance, but it could equally be any other industry that has the right problems that I want to be solving. I'm particularly keen on distributed systems, large volumes of data, clean architecture and the right culture.

As for what I bring to the table...

*   **Empathy** towards colleagues and customers, we're all facing different problems and understanding/supporting others brings about a much better working environment and is seen in the final solution.
*   **Constant Improvement**, in amongst whatever I'm working on that day I try to find one thing, even if its something small that I can do to leave something better than it was yesterday. That might be documentation, automation, a refactoring or some small tweak that will at some point make someone else's day a little better.
*   **Debugging**, after many years of owning in some way large legacy code bases my debugging skills have grown massively. I treat each issue (Opportunity) as a puzzle that needs solving and as much as it often feels like an impossible problem to solve there will be a win when it falls into place, and you beat it. I genuinely enjoy this stuff!
*   **SQL Server**, I've spent a long time levling up skills in this area, in particular tuning queries and databases. There are very few places where 5 minutes work can lead to 100x performance gains, but this is one of them. I've also given several talks at local user groups around Indexes, The Query Optimizer and Query Plans.
*   **Mentoring**, in a number of my positions I've been responsible for more junior members of the team. I've learned a lot about mentoring, code reviews and communication through these engagements. 
*   **Automating** all of the things, Watching a manual task that was requiring weekend work, or repetitive step by step instructions to be followed run automatically for the first few times feels excellent! If it needs to be done more than once on a schedule with no end date then if it can be automated it should be. Freeing up people to work on other things adds tremendous value to the business, I've worked on many automations from configuring new Developer Environments, Killing hung database connections to Restoring a production database's and log files to point in time. 

I don't want to list the tech stack too much as it has varied over the years and I'm comfortable learning most things. I will say though I've spent most of my career in the Microsoft Stack C#, SQL Server, and ASPNet. Outside of that stack I firmly believe in the right tool for the job, some of the tools I have used include RabbitMQ, Docker, SSIS, Powershell, Dotnet Core, Windows Services, Azure, Angular, WebAPI, WCF, WPF, Xamarin and many more.
