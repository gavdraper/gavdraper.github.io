I'm in the process of changing web hosts and having a few issues.

The site will probably be up and down for the next day, please bare with me.

<strong>UPDATE</strong> The site is kind of back up. Obviously the styling is way out as the blog is currently running the default wordpress theme and also a number of posts that contain source code have been screwed up, this should be resolved over the weekend.

<strong>UPDATE 2</strong> I've applied a rough theme so the site looks a bit better. I've also ported a copy of the About, Projects and Contact accross from the old portfolio site and in to the blog with the intention of merging the 2. Eveything still looks quite rought and will probably not be 100% until Monday.
Thanks
