Another day another released project. I've just finished developing the web site for Usual Suspects Tattoo Studio.

The site has a gallery and comments system both of which are stored in an XML backend and have CMS functionality. It all runs through a LinqToSql data tier and makes for a light weight web site framework that has no database dependencies.

I've got a lot of future improvements planned for the framework that I intend to use for future sites but for now the following features are currently implemented in the  first solution
<ul>
	<li> JQuery Asynchronous Uploader</li>
	<li> Friendly URLs</li>
	<li> User Comments</li>
	<li> Content Managed Gallery</li>
	<li> Google Maps Intergration</li>
	<li> JQuery Lightbox</li>
	<li> Modified JQuery Lightbox Show Reel</li>
</ul>
To see this implementation check out <a href="http://www.usualsuspectstattoo.co.uk">http://www.usualsuspectstattoo.co.uk</a>.

Stay tuned for details on future updates to the framework which for now I am calling Nimble.
