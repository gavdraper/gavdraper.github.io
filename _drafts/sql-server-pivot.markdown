The PIVOT/UNPIVOT features in SQL Server is I find quite underused. For a long time I got by with SELECT, JOIN, GROUP in SQL Server and missed out on some really handy features like PIVOT, CROSS APPLY, MERGE, XML and more recently JSON. Each of these features has a time and a place and if you don't know about them then you could be missing out on some really handy tools.
